# Peppy mobile style guide

`packages/mobile-design` is the source and deterministic generator for shared
native design outputs. Run `pnpm --dir packages/mobile-design generate`; CI and
reviews use `pnpm --dir packages/mobile-design check` for drift.

## Generated native API

- Android imports `dev.peppy.mobile.ui.theme.PeppyTokens` and chooses
  `PeppyTokens.Dark` or `PeppyTokens.Light` from the system theme.
- iOS uses `PeppyTokens.colors(for: colorScheme)`. Its generated symbols use
  PascalCase semantic names (for example `Accent`, `SurfacePanel`).
- Android copy is `@string/peppy_<catalog_key>`. iOS strings live in the
  **Peppy** table: use `String(localized: "peppy.<catalog_key>", table: "Peppy")`
  or `Text("peppy.<catalog_key>", tableName: "Peppy")`. The default table does
  not find these keys. Wrap computed SwiftUI keys in `LocalizedStringKey`;
  accessibility labels also need a localized value or `Text` from this table.
- Add shared copy only to `src/catalog.mjs`, never directly to platform output.
  Native outputs use its filtered `nativeCatalog`; desktop uses
  `desktopCatalog`. A key present in the shared source is not necessarily
  shipped on mobile: preview/store-only keys are intentionally excluded.

Use native typography and touch targets with a 4px spacing rhythm; do not copy
desktop control dimensions. Use the coral graphic brand and semantic coral accents; coral is not normal-size text, follow the
system light/dark appearance, and retain opaque readable content when reduced
transparency or motion is enabled. Use stable semantic native test identifiers.

For a changed shared mobile behavior, update and test Rust, bindings, Android,
and iOS when they are affected. State platform capability exceptions explicitly;
do not force meaningless edits to unaffected surfaces.
